		<h3>What is Nomad2016?</h3>
		<p>Nomad2016 is a tool that connects volunteers who want to travel to canvass with carpools of other volunteers traveling to canvass. Nomad2016 is a fancy version of the old campaign office bulletin board. Carpool drivers can post their rides - start location and time, destination, and return time - and volunteers who need rides can get in with carpool drivers by asking to join a ride. If a rider doesn't see a ride that works for them, they can add their name to the wait list, and be notified when new rides are created.</p>
		<h3>What makes Nomad2016 different from a campaign office bulletin board?</h3>
		<p>Nomad2016 makes it easier to post a ride and to sign up for one. You can do so from home, or even on your smartphone! Nomad2016 also helps protect drivers' privacy - their contact information is only shared with riders once the driver has approved the rider for the carpool.</p>
		<h3>Who can use Nomad2016?</h3>
		<p>Anyone older than 13 years old may use the site, but only for the purposes of supporting Democratic and progressive candidates.</p>
		<h3>Where can I use Nomad2016?</h3>
		<p>You can use it to post or find a ride to anywhere from anywhere, from now until November 8, 2016.</p>
		<h3>I'm signed up for a ride with Nomad2016. Does this mean I'm signed up to canvass?</h3>
		<p>NO! Nomad2016 only connects people for rides to their out-of-state canvass. Please also sign up for the canvass event either at your local field office or where you're canvassing!</p>
		<h3>When will I get information about where I'm canvassing and what I'm supposed to do when I get there?</h3>
		<p>Talk to your local field office! If you have signed up to canvass out of state with either your local field office or the field office where you're canvassing, they will reach out to you with information about the details of your canvass. Remember, Nomad2016 is only able to help connect you with other people for the purpose of carpooling. We don't know the specifics about canvassing. We leave that to the experts in the field!</p>
		<h3>Should I have a great time canvassing?</h3>
		<p>You absolutely should. Have the best time. :)</p>
